        - "Event Recommendation GPT: A search and discovery utility tool for real-life events. The system consists of:"
        - title: RAG
          contents:
            - Fine-tuned a distilled BERT model with GPT-generated metadata to support metadata-based filtering, achieving 90% accuracy while reducing latency by 75%
            - Implemented a dense retrieval pipeline leveraging OpenAI embeddings, followed by re-ranking via Jina AI's cross-encoder
            - Incorporated multi-dimensional signals such as venue information and out-of-distribution scoring to prioritize unique and diverse events
        - title: Memory Module
          contents:
            - Implemented a custom memory architecture to store long-term user preferences (e.g., preferred genres, locations)
            - The implementation includes tool-calling for CRUD operations on memory
            - The current module is 85% accurate at extracting user preferences
        - "Multi-Turn Summarizer: Implemented standard techniques to support multi-turn conversation by maintaining state of the conversation via summarizer"
        - "ReAct Tool-Calling Framework: To support multiple queries, the RAG pipeline is encapsulated via a ReACT tool-calling framework. Queries include: weekly calendar creation and daily planner which includes restaurants, activities and events"
        - "Test dataset: Automatic pipeline to curate and store events for testing different components of RAG pipeline. The pipeline also includes E2E testing via GEval and DeepEvals"
    - title: Software Engineer
      institution: Walmart, Chennai, India
      year: Jul 2022 - Jul 2024
      description:
        - Confluence based Chatbot: Spearheaded the development of Confluence-integrated chatbot using Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG) and Large Language Models(LLMs) to generate Walmart's system specific text responses. Responsible for building the backend using FastAPI(python), LangChain, and OpenAI's chatGPT API
        - The Minion Project: Played a key role in developing APIs for the Automated Continuous Monitoring System, affectionately known as Minion. This effort enhanced Time to Detect(TTD) by 50%, eventually leading to its adoption as a framework across all critical Walmart systems. The APIs are developed using FastAPI(python)
        - Project Galaxy: Spearheaded the development of the frontend of the Project Galaxy which focused on quick recovery from a bug across multiple systems(and teams). The project involved more than five dependent different teams. This effort enhanced Time to Recover(TTR) by 30%
        - Bravo award: Honored with the Bravo Award for outstanding contributions
    - title: Machine Learning Associate
      institution: Tavlab, Delhi, India
      year: Nov 2020 - Oct 2023
      description:
        - Addressed biomedical challenges: Applied NLP (BioBERT, GPT-3.5, Mistral) embeddings and Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, SVM, Gradient Boosting) to solve biomedical challenges. Focused on tasks including sepsis prediction, abnormal shock index prediction, mortality estimation, and length of stay analysis
        - Implemented modeling sharding on multi-GPU setup and increased inference speed by 15%
        - Achieved state-of-the-art results
        - COVID Gene Sequencing: Built a transformer based model to understand genomic sequences for covid strains. Using the next-sentence prediction task, transformed the DNA sequence into codons and built a vocabulary of all the possible codons. Then trained the model on a large corpus of existing known DNA sequences. Built a regression model on top of this model to predict the number of patients in the next 1-, 2-, and 3-months

      description:
        - video2vec-U: Built an end-to-end, unsupervised Visual Speech Recognition system that combines computer vision and natural language processing models, inspired by the wav2vec-U framework
        - Fine-tuned visual-encoder(CNN and ViT-based model) and Language Model(n-gram, LSTM, and transformer) from scratch to capture visual features(mainly facial features) of the speaker
        - Used multi-GPU setup for fine-tuning on large-scale video dataset

      year: 2023-2024
      description: Open source python library for building quick RAG over confluence. Allows quick connections to slack and chat bot systems.
    - title: Attention-Aware DPO
      year: 2024
      description: Large Language Vision Models(LLVMs) suffer from inadequacies when multi-image query is prompted. In this project, we modified the existing DPO loss(used for human preference alignment) to include a grounding loss based on model's attention mechanism.
    - title: Multilingual Retrieval Heads
      year: 2024-Present
      description: Large Language Models(LLMs) are effective at extracting key information from a long in-context prompt. But how did LLM excel at this task? We mechanistically explain this phenomenon in multilingual setting. Currently in work with Professor Eunsol Choi.
