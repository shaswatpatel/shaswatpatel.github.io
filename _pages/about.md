I am a Machine Learning Engineer and Researcher currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at New York University. My research interests lie at the intersection of Large Language Models, Mechanistic Interpretability, and applications of LLM.

I have worked on various projects involving RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems, fine-tuning transformer models, and applying machine learning to solve biomedical challenges. Currently, I'm working as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern at Studio Management, where I'm developing an Event Recommendation GPT system with advanced RAG capabilities. Checkout [Outie](https://www.outie.life/home).

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at Walmart, where I developed Confluence-integrated chatbots and automated monitoring systems. I also have experience as a Machine Learning Associate at Tavlab and MIDAS LAB, where I worked on biomedical NLP tasks, visual speech recognition, and COVID gene sequencing projects. Currently I am working with [Dr. Eunsol Choi](https://eunsol.github.io/) and [Dr. He He](https://hhexiy.github.io/).

My work has been published in venues including MICCAI MLMI Workshop, ACL Workshop, and Medrxiv. I'm also passionate about teaching and have served as a Teaching Assistant for courses in [Algorithmic Problem Solving](https://cs.nyu.edu/~joannakl/aps_s21/problem_grading.html), [Data Structures](https://cims.nyu.edu/~joannakl/cs102/syllabus.html) and [Building LLM Reasoners](https://gregdurrett.github.io/courses/sp2026/index.html) at NYU.
